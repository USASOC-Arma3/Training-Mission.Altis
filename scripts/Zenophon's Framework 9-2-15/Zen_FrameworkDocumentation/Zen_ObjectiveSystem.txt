Objective System

Meant to simplify side missions, the objective system allows you to easily add something extra for players to do in a mission, without worrying about getting different parts of an objective to work.  The system handles the object itself, the task, and marker for the objective.  It is up to you to spawn guards and patrols around the objective.

Zen_CreateObjective

Creates an objective and the task for it and completes the task when the objective is
completed.  Nothing is spawned other than the objective.  The side is that of the
objective, not who will complete it.  Only the given units see the task and the marker for
the objective.  You can create invalid combinations of arguments for which function
behavior is undefined.
