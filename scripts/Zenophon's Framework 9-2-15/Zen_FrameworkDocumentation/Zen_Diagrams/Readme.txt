Function Diagrams

For a few commonly used functions, it is useful to have a visual outline of the parameters and the different values you can enter.  Framework functions are meant to be flexible, accepting various arguments to customize their use.  The diagrams are also a good aid while doing the tutorials, to see why the tutorials use the functions the way they do.  These are also helpful when reading the How To Use Documentation file, to see how the text descriptions translate to visual meaning.

The diagrams are done in a standard format, used in professional software development, so they are not that friendly for complete beginners.  However, if you have already read the text documentation, the diagrams can help to clarify.  They also show all the different combinations of argument types in a verbose form, rather than the compact notation of the text documentation.

To view them, just open the .html file in each folder using a browser.  All other files are just assets used to generate the final diagram.
