Tutorials

These tutorials were created by an associate of mine with over 35 years experience in professional software design.  Originally, I had no intention of including beginner tutorials or guides of any kind.  However, the benefit to beginning mission makers, my framework, and the community is now obvious to me.

The tutorials are the perfect starting point for any new scripter, and they showcase what the framework is meant to achieve: easy, fun missions that improve the quality of ArmA gameplay for everyone.  They are straightforward, clear, do not skip steps, and do not leave you confused.  I will let the tutorials speak for themselves, and I only suggest that you read TutorialIntroduction.pdf and start with the first tutorial.
